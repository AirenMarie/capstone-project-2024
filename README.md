# capstone-project-2024

This project is a task-tracking app that also includes functions to set reminders and exercises for mindfulness and relaxation, including breathing and meditation, as well as relaxing music.

For my calendar, I am using Google Calendar API. My server is Express. I chose Browserify as my bundler, so that back-end code could be read by my browser. I am using ESLint to format my code.
