1. use one API (calendar), another one (music) if I can manage

2. take out the sign-in and sign-up pages for now

3. finish styles after implementing API(s), if there is time

4. DO NOT overthink anything!

5. Ask for help...but do it before next Wednesday or you might get glares

6. remember to eat something and get some sleep

7. pet the cat because he knows you're capable üêà

Planned APIs:

- Motion REST API, Google Calendar REST API, or Bryntum Calendar API
- Spotify REST API (if there is time)

As of 12/15/24:

1. uninstall Webpack and delete existing node_modules and .json files, as well as webpack.config.js

2. unlink Google API JS files from HTML files

3. install Vite

4. begin working with Bryntum API (after doing the tutorial)

5. pet the cat because he knows you're capable üêà

6. see if you can squeeze in Spotify API if there is time (honestly, there probably isn't, this is due on 12/19)
